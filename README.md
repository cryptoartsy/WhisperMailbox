# WhisperMailbox Overview

## Purpose: 
From the [Art Project](https://medium.com/truebit/statements-on-creative-alliances-and-integrated-participation-6afdead8786a) community, this is a piece for the Doge-Etherium Bridge art installation that is connected to the Blockchain. The installation will be a Klein Bottle structure that will fit around 40 people and be on display for about two years. The exact location is TBA. This repo is meant to be a place where we share everything we have done to build this installation so that it may replicated by you, the reader.

## Human Interaction: 
A visitor to this piece will be met with a funnel that may remind them of their playground days, like this:<p align="center">

</p>
 The idea is, humans will whisper their deepest, darkest secrets into the Ethereum blockchain network using the Whisper Protocol through this funnel. You can read more about how Whisper works [here](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Whisper). 

## Expected Result: 
As a message is "whispered" into this piece of the installation, the sound will be converted into a 10-bit binary to an expecting Whisper Network node (RPi3) which will activate a series of programmable LEDs events throughout a main hall of the structure. These LEDs will represent the percolation of the message data throughout each node on the Whisper Network, until it has reached it's "destination".
